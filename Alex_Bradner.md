## Values & Philosophies

* Don't use black boxes - Understand the strengths and limitations of your tooling
* Hypothesize, validate and iterate. Ideally before any code is written.
* Maximise customer impact - We build products and write software for them, not us.
* Relatedly:
  * Find opportunities for customer delight where possible
  * Understand the opportunity cost and value of tradeoffs. Make tradeoffs aggresively if it directly serves impact.
* Write code for the eventual reader.
  * Be expressive, clear and accessible.
  * Optimise where relevant but make those decisions obvious and easy to understand.
* Be kind. Uplift my peers and juniors to be their best
* Be aware of your biases. They can add colour to your perspective but don't let them harm others
