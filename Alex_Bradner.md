## Values & Philosophies

* Don't use black boxes - Understand the strengths and limitations of your tooling.
* Hypothesize, validate and iterate. Ideally before any code is written.
* Maximise customer impact - We build products and write software for them, not us.
* Relatedly:
  * Find opportunities for customer delight where possible.
  * Understand both the opportunity cost and value of tradeoffs. Make tradeoffs aggresively if it directly serves impact.
* Write code for the eventual reader.
  * Be expressive, clear and accessible.
  * Optimise where relevant but make those decisions obvious and easy to understand.
* Be kind, clarify miscommunications and be willing to forgive.
* Uplift your peers and juniors to be their best.
* Be aware of your biases. They can add colour to your perspective but don't let them harm others.
* Fostering diversity & inclusion is the responsibility of the already-included, not the diverse.

## Projects & Impact

* Airtasker SEO Engine
  * The architectural backbone for this is still the core of SEO landing page generation at airtasker - our primary acquisition channel in both growing and established markets
* Two fundamentally different recommendation systems that have each produced major uplift in conversion from their launch:
  * Providing real-time relevent task recommendations to taskers (workers) in a very fast-moving marketplace where seeing a task 5 minutes late can mean loss of a job
  * Providing qualitative and quantitative recommendations of services to potential customers where little is known about the customer's intent beforehand
* International Launches - 4 countries in different capacities
  * UK - Senior Engineer & Man with many hats post-launch
    * UX research
    * Local product & engineering support
    * de facto engineering product owner whilst in London
  * NZ & Singapore - Technical lead & acting product manager
  * USA - Technical lead, acting product & business operations manager
    * While all have provided major growth opportunities, delivering the US launch despite management hesitency allowed Airtasker to acquire & integrate a local services marketplace startup that is now the grass-roots backbone of our fastest growing market in the world
