## Values & Philosophies

### Toward People

* Listen, understand, learn, grow.
* Be kind, clarify miscommunications and be willing to forgive.
* Uplift your peers and juniors to be their best.
* Be gentle but firm with your convictions. At the same time be able to explain why you hold them.
* Be aware of your biases. They can add colour to your perspective but don't let them harm others.
* Fostering diversity & inclusion is the responsibility of the already-included, not the diverse.

### In Engineering

* Don't use black boxes - Understand the strengths and limitations of your tooling.
* Write code for the eventual reader.
  * Be expressive, clear and accessible.
  * Optimise where relevant but make those decisions obvious and easy to understand.

### In Business

* Always ask 'Why?' (and don't stop until there is a satisfying explanation).
* Hypothesize, validate and iterate. Ideally before any code is written.
* Maximise customer impact - We build products and write software for them, not us.
* Relatedly:
  * Find opportunities for customer delight where possible.
  * Understand both the opportunity cost and value of tradeoffs. Make tradeoffs aggresively if it directly serves impact.

## My Experience

### Where I've worked (at a glance)

#### Aug 2024 - Now — Atlassian (Principal Engineer)

> You've used Atlassian products before – most likely Jira & Confluence, maybe Trello or Loom – but let me take you behind the curtain where I can:

As a remote-first workplace serving organisations of all sizes (from SMB to government enterprise), Atlassian focuses on helping teams get work done.

I’ve been providing engineering expertise and leadership as a Principal Engineer within Atlassian’s Teamwork Platform, where we build the behind-the-scenes technology that seamlessly connects Jira, Confluence, and other Atlassian tools (plus third-party apps).

This work allows users to embed and interact with content across products without juggling multiple windows or losing context, and it creates a rich knowledge graph that fuels our AI capabilities.

#### Sep 2022 - Nov 2023 — AirRobe (Principal Engineer)

> AirRobe is focussed on reducing the negative impacts of fast fashion by making buying and selling your pre-loved fashion painless and safe.

As a three-sided marketplace (buyer, seller and theoriginal merchant partner), it's almost impossible to deliver a great experience for everyone given the natural conflict between all three parties, but understanding that razor's edge is what makes AirRobe the best marketplace for everyone (especially the environment) to experience the circular economy.

#### Apr-Sep 2022 — CBA / x15 Ventures: Cheddar  (Principal Engineer)

> Cheddar was CBA's answer to Shopback, Cashrewards and other similar platforms. It had two key driving principals: Find and engage with a new audience (specifically Gen Z) for CBA & merchant partners, and provide that audience with a compelling shopping experience as a gateway to other CBA products and services.

##### Principal Engineer

While the business model was a well-trodden path, being an x15 venture allowed me to bring my startup experience to bear. I was building user-focussed product, training, mentoring and growing the engineering team all whilst navigating the complexities of working within one of the largest and most trusted enterprise brands in the country.

### Recent Experience - Details

#### Atlassian

Continued from [above](#aug-2024---now--atlassian-principal-engineer)

My tenure so far has been short, but I have been exposed to (and required to take responsibility for) many concerns in domains across the entire company.

My team is responsible for smart-linking between products, enabling rich interactions and content association across both the Atlassian ecosystem and any relevant third-party datasources.

> ##### ℹ️ What's a smart link?
>
> A rich link to another resource (a page, ticket, file, figma design, etc) built from pasting a simple url.
>
> It not only provides the user with the ***right amount of information*** where they need it, it provides a ***context-rich connection*** between these two resources allowing AI assitive tools (in this case Atlassian's Rovo) to ***build better knowledge and provide better answers***.

> I had the pleasure of working with Alex on the service consolidation project last quarter and was impressed by the strengths he brought to the table.
>
> **Quick Learner:** Despite joining Atlassian recently, Alex quickly familiarised himself with our service capabilities, including \[*services across five domains*]. His rapid onboarding was instrumental in framing solutions, addressing incidents, and providing valuable ad-hoc feedback in the channel.
>
> **Scalability-Focused Solutions:** Alex demonstrated a strong Principal Engineer mindset, proposing a solution for \[*a top-line project*] that not only addressed the immediate challenges but also considered future scalability. This forward-thinking approach ensured the project’s long-term success and highlighted the importance of keeping the bigger picture in mind — a valuable learning for me personally.
>
> Alex’s adaptability and strategic thinking were pivotal, and I look forward in seeing the project reach its final goal.

> He has been navigating the challenging migration of \[*internal services*] as we consolidate these services. He has shown strong domain expertise through making necessary >
architectural adaptations to our services, all of which he investigated and validated prior, in a short timeframe.
>
> Furthermore, he has directly delivered many complex changes and provided well thought out advice and timely feedback to others including myself on the project to ensure >
incremental solution delivery proceeds without a hitch as planned.
>
> Outside of this direct project, Alex consistently provides insightful feedback drawing on his wealth of experience as well as to many other people’s \[*proposed project designs and architecture*]. Amazing work!

> -- R

> Alex is a strong engineer who is great at collaboration and finding scalable solutions to complex problems.
>
> **PROJECT IMPACT**; **DIRECTION**
>
> Alex has been driving “Service reduction” project to reduce the cost of Smart Links services. During the project, Alex proposed a well thought-through approach for integrating smart link \[*business logic*] into \[*a fit-for-purpose alternative service*].
>
> He suggested a scalable solution for complex use-cases that will benefit not only this project, but further projects and teams that need to orchestrate \[*business logic behaviours*].

## Other Projects & Impact

* AirRobe Personalisation & Recommendation Engines
  * Challenge: Keep customers sticky by showing them things that we know they like
  * Problem 1: We don't have a good understanding of what they like
  * Problem 2: We don't have any mechanism to surface relevant things even if we did know.
  * Outcome: Tooling that:
    * tracks and weighs customer interactions (purchases, wishlists, views, searches etc) with different items in our inventory, 
    * aggregates interest based on numerous facets (eg brand, department, size, colour, material etc)
    * creates interest graphs for each user
    * uses the interest graph to query our latest inventory
    * presents a curated selection to customers in a number of different formats (email, feeds etc)
  * Delivered 10x engagement over manually curated emails and feeds
* Airtasker SEO Engine
  * The architectural backbone for this is still the core of SEO landing page generation at airtasker - our primary acquisition channel in both growing and established markets
* Two fundamentally different recommendation systems that have each produced major uplift in conversion from their launch:
  * Providing real-time relevent task recommendations to taskers (workers) in a very fast-moving marketplace where seeing a task 5 minutes late can mean loss of a job
  * Providing qualitative and quantitative recommendations of services to potential customers where little is known about the customer's intent beforehand
* International Launches - 4 countries in different capacities
  * UK - Senior Engineer & Man with many hats post-launch
    * UX research
    * Local product & engineering support
    * de facto engineering product owner whilst in London
  * NZ & Singapore - Technical lead & acting product manager
  * USA - Technical lead, acting product & business operations manager
    * While all have provided major growth opportunities, delivering the US launch despite management hesitency allowed Airtasker to acquire & integrate a local services marketplace startup that is now the grass-roots backbone of our fastest growing market in the world
